You are constantly running commands to make your code accessible to others, and resolving conflicts because someone didn’t update their code regularly. Also, you have to remember to never pull before committing. Who made those rules?</span><span>We thought software developers write code all day every day. However, based on our research developers spend about 5 hours on admin tasks. This means, if you have 10 mid-level Developers costing you about $59 per hour (8 hours per day), you are losing around $2 950 per day, $14,750 per week or $59,000 per month to manual/admin tasks. In terms of time, a project that is due in 6 months will be delivered in 13 months.</span></p></div><div><h4><span>Your code might be at risk!</span><span>Your project might be at risk!</span></h4><p><span>Either due to unexpected conflicts or hardware failure, you can loose your code any day unless everyone you collaborate with makes regular backups and doesn’t go for 3 days without commiting.
